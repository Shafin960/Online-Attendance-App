# Online-Attendance-App
When an agent enters the app, he will see a list of stores in the app. The store list is coming from an API call. Whenever an agent clicks on an item he will be able to see the details of the shop. There are 55 pages in total and each page has 10 shop names. The video demonstration and the APK file of the app is given below in the drive link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1aAM8EUXIF-YTOOZChs3liIjSGWkvaMuN?usp=drive_link
